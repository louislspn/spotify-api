## 1. Introduction

This library allows you to make server-sided requests to the Spotify API using an authorization code and access token.
It will handle access token and refresh token generation for you.

Make sure to have all the requirements bellow before using this library : 

- node.js
- npm
- a Spotify API application ([documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/))
- a Spotify authorization code ([documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow))

```

### Install dependencies

In the freshly installed theme folder run the command below :
```

```

## 3. Configuration

To be able to make requests using this library, you will have to store your API informations (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri and code).

Create a JSON file named ```creds.json``` in the ```utils``` folder

```json
{
  "client_id": "",
  "client_secret": "",
  "redirect_uri": "",
  "code": ""
}
```

Complete the JSON file with your informations. You can find them on your Spotify dashboard [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

The ```code```can be retrieved following [those steps](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).

## 4. Run server

Once you have created and filled the JSON file, you can run your local server with the command ```npm run start```.

It will start an express server on ```localhost:4000``` where you can create routes and requests.

## 5. Contributing

This library is open source, feel free to pull request any modification or improvement. You can change the request function to match your need as the current function is a pretty basic one.
